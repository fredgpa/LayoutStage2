# LayoutStage2



This project's objective is to confirm and possibly surpass the results achieved by the paper
"Optimal shipyard facility layout planning based on a genetic algorithm and stochastic growth algorithm"

It is a Matlab code and uses a genetic algorithm framework available for free in Mathworks website as a base, having some of its functions modified.

The second stage consists of a stochastic algorithm generating the individuals used in ga, in order to find a optimal geometry for the departments which had their topology fixed on the first stage.
